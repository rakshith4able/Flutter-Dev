//When we insert any of the dice image it overflows becoz of its large size
//We can set width of the image bt it will be hardcoded, so not preferred
//We use Expanded class which expands to fill available space on a row or column

//actions can be included to dice images by enclosing them within TextButton
//print() is used to print message in console

//variables can be declared using var keyword
//We can use variables inside a string by using $variable_name within quotes
//If we want changes to the variable to be updated in the UI we have to include the variabble inside the build method

//Dart is statically typed language -
//Because We cannot assign a different type value to variable assigned with different type of value before using var
//We can create a variable that doesnt have a fixed data type by not initializing any value while creating using var or using dynamic keyword
//Dart Data Type-
//Primitive Data Types -> String , int, double,bool
//Use dartpad to work with dart programming

//Difference B/w Stateless and Stateful Widgets
//If the state of the widget doesnt change we use stateless Widget
//If the state of the widget is expected to change we have to use stateful widgets
//The shortcut to create stateful widget is stful
//stateful widgets have 2 parts 1st class is similar to stateless widgets another class is to change the state
//We have to place the changes inside the setState() to rebuild UI on hot reload
