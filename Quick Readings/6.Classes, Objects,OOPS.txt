//Classes and Objects
//Classes are blue print and objects are working model
//Classes contains properties and methods
//Classes are used because OOP is possible
//4 pillars of OOP- Abstraction,Encapsulation,Inheritance,Polymorphism
//1)Data abstraction refers to Splitting huge code into small modules(classes) which individually performs specific tasks.
//2)Encapsulation is nothing but building wall between the abstracted classes.
// To make a property of class private we add _ at the beginning of the property name in class
//3)Inheritance- a class is able to inherit properties and methods from parent
// We use extends keyword to achieve inheritance
//4)Polymorphism- When we inherit methods from parent andwe want the same method with different implementation
// in child class we have to override it @override
//If we want to carry out parent version of method we can use super.method() in child implementation using @override.
